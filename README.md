Volt:
- max: 72

Speed:
- max: 80
- min: 0

Time:
- 8am - 8pm => 12hrs
  

Normal Vibration Values

Idle / normal operating: 25 – 40 Hz → this is when the motor is running smoothly.

Moderate load: 40 – 70 Hz → typical while driving or with some extra load.

High / warning: 70 – 100 Hz → something may be off: misalignment, imbalance, worn bearings.

Anything consistently above 80 – 100 Hz should raise a warning to inspect the motor.


## Telemetry

| Metric                     | Calculation / Formula                         | Notes / Normal Range              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Battery (V)**            | Last recorded battery voltage                 | Typical: 30–72 V                  |
| **Vibration (Hz)**         | Last recorded vibration reading               | Normal: 25–40 Hz, Warning: >40 Hz |
| **Temperature (°C)**       | Last recorded motor temperature               | Normal: 35–60°C                   |
| **Mileage / Speed (km/h)** | Distance ÷ Time traveled                      | Average per day                   |
| **Tire (PSI)**             | Last recorded tire pressure                   | Depends on motor/vehicle          |
| **Week Start/End**         | Derived from selected week (`start + 6 days`) | For charts and week label         |

**Key idea:** Most metrics just show the **latest value** in the selected week. Charts use all daily values. Thresholds (like vibration > 40 Hz) can trigger warnings later.


## Mileage
Max Mileage=Max Speed×Max Time=80×12=960 km


## Tires
Normal tire pressure for tricycles: 32–36 PSI.

Warning: 28–32 PSI or 36–38 PSI.
